# Is your interaction irreducibly quantified?

# Introduction
The hydrodynamic limit is a mathematical method that derives macroscopic deterministic partial differential equations as limits from microscopic large scale interacting systems. 
Varadahn's decomposition theorem plays an important role to prove the hydlodynamic limit for non-gradient model. 
In the studies Bannai-Kametani-Sasada [^BKS] and Bannai-Sasada [^BS], they prove Varadahn's decomposition theorem for a general class of large scale interacting system. 
In their setting, microscopic large scale interacting systems is constructed by interactions. 
For the definitions, please see thier papers. 
In their studies, they consider the condition of interactions, which is called *irreducibly quntified*, as the suitable assumption for the hydrodynamic limit.

If you have seen the definition of irreducibly quntifiedness, you might think that confirming this condition requires an infinite number of steps at first glance.
However,ã€€I prove that this can be determined in a finite number of steps in my paper.

This program is check wheather your interaction is irreducibly quantified by using my algorithm.
